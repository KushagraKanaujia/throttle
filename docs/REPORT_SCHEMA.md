# Report contract (schema 2.0)

Throttle writes mode-0600 JSON with `allow_nan=false`. Run artifacts use:

```text
schema_version       "2.0"
artifact_type        "throttle_run"
mode                 "smoke" | "benchmark"
status               running | complete | failed | stopped | cancelled
decision_eligible    boolean
manifest             versioned workload/runtime/request/cost/safety contract
conditions[]         warm-up diagnostics, repeated blocks, aggregate evidence
best_tested          descriptive tested-condition boundary/CI state
run_totals           started/completed/cancelled/error/token reservations
cost_summary         one tagged billing model only
stop_reason          fixed sanitized code or null
```

Comparison artifacts use `artifact_type: throttle_comparison`. Six-position
golden artifacts use `artifact_type: throttle_golden_live_comparison` and add
protocol eligibility/order-balanced contrasts. Supported, decision-eligible
golden artifacts additionally include `decision_summary`; it is null for every
ineligible or inconclusive result. A stopped orchestration writes
`artifact_type: throttle_golden_session` with completed-position names and a
fixed sanitized stop reason, never a recommendation.

The opt-in `experimental-tuning` command does not extend any of those artifact
types. It writes two separate mode-0600 files:

```text
ordinary measurement     artifact_type "throttle_run", mode "smoke"
supplementary output      artifact_type "throttle_experimental_tuning_envelope"
```

The ordinary report remains schema 2.0, contains no tuning fields, and is
non-decision-grade at both the run and condition levels. The experimental
envelope contains exactly its schema/artifact tags, an
`ordinary_report_sha256` binding, and the nested `safety_projection`. The
digest is SHA-256 of the sanitized report encoded as sorted, compact,
ASCII-escaped JSON with non-finite values forbidden. It is an equality and
linkability check, not a signature.

The nested safety projection is detached and allowlisted. Its `decision_eligible`,
`auto_apply`, `guaranteed_outcome`, `golden_validation_performed`,
`golden_protocol_eligible`, `changes_applied`,
`configuration_change_authorized`, `can_bypass_decision_gates`,
`cli_integration_authorized`, and `report_integration_authorized` fields are
all false. The two authorization fields mean the artifact cannot route itself
into another CLI or standard report path; the explicitly selected experimental
subcommand may only present the already-audited projection.
The retained `isolated_preintegration_validation` scope describes validation
before any standard report or decision integration; it does not mean the
detached projection lacks this one reviewed experimental presenter.
Any suggestion additionally depends on an operator attestation that the
exporter belongs to the inference deployment under test and saw no unrelated
traffic during the sampled window. Neither fact is independently proven or
encoded as raw exporter data; labels and snapshots are deliberately discarded.

Comparison and Golden validators do not consume the supplementary artifact.
Its optional Golden handoff records only a positive, distinct
`max_num_seqs` pair and offered concurrency for a future test. It always says
that Golden has not been performed and is not yet eligible. The existing
six-position command must independently revalidate the pair, offered load,
runtime provenance, ordering, evidence, SLOs, and statistical gates.

Golden comparison and session artifacts include a sanitized treatment block:

```json
{
  "field": "max_num_seqs",
  "baseline_value": 8,
  "candidate_value": 10,
  "closed_loop_concurrency": 16
}
```

For a complete comparison, these values are inferred from the six saved
runtime-verified effective-flag and traffic manifests rather than trusted from
CLI input. The block remains present for a statistically inconclusive complete
comparison; malformed evidence may produce `treatment: null`. Reaching the
recorded client concurrency proves offered demand, not direct server-scheduler
saturation.

Golden artifacts label `run_fingerprint_basis` as
`validated_consumed_evidence_projection_v1`. Each `run_fingerprints` entry
hashes only the bounded, schema-validated evidence consumed by report and
Golden validation. Safe forward-extension fields are deliberately omitted so
the digest cannot become an oracle for ignored payloads; a structurally or
semantically invalid source report receives a null fingerprint.

A supported `decision_summary` contains a fixed workload-scoped label, the
winning variant and inferred `max_num_seqs` value, the candidate-relative
throughput delta, its order-balanced 95% interval/method,
`ci_excludes_zero: true`, the declared SLO gates that passed, and the exact
terminal summary text. It never contains a savings, optimum, or
universal-performance claim.

New run artifacts use runtime manifest `1.1`. It retains the manifest `1.0`
CUDA keys for compatibility and adds an accelerator backend, generic
accelerator identity/fingerprint, accelerator runtime version, host OS version,
and immutable software-environment digest. Saved manifest `1.0` CUDA reports
remain readable and comparable with other `1.0` reports; different manifest
versions are never treated as the same controlled runtime.

Native request manifests carry `profile_version: "1.0"`, typed temperature,
optional `top_p` and request seed, a sorted map of validated non-secret scalar
extensions, and `profile_sha256`. The digest covers every persisted request
control other than itself. Comparison accepts historical fixed request
manifests, but a sealed profile cannot compare with an unsealed or different
profile.

## Decision gate

`decision_eligible` is derived, not a caller assertion. A normal comparison
recomputes manifest completeness, disjoint warm-ups, block order/shape and
observed concurrency, request/token/run totals, timestamps, safety and billing
math, zero invalid responses, and the 200-request/60-second floor. Smoke,
partial, stopped, cancelled,
GuideLLM aggregate, legacy schema 1.0, unknown schema, missing controls, output
length mismatch, unexercised treatments, and unsupported confidence intervals
cannot become decision-grade by editing a boolean in JSON.

Open-loop manifests pin a 5% achieved-rate tolerance and a p95 scheduler-lag
ceiling of one target inter-arrival interval. Every block records its actual
launch window, achieved offered rate, relative error, and lag ratio. Saved-run
preflight recomputes those values; missing the offered load is
decision-ineligible.

Request-level `p95_ci` fields are bounded bootstrap diagnostics. Aggregate
E2E/TTFT distributions additionally carry `p95_repeated_block_ci`, a 95%
Student-t interval over the p95 from each measured block. SLO qualification and
saved/golden decisions use only that repeated-block interval, and saved-run
preflight recomputes it from the block evidence.

`metrics.output_tokens_per_second` is the pooled descriptive ratio of all valid
completion tokens to total measured condition wall time.
`block_mean_output_tokens_per_second` and its
`block_mean_output_tokens_per_second_ci` are the repeated-block decision
estimate and interval. Best-tested selection uses that block-mean estimate, so
the point estimate and CI always describe the same estimand.
The derived best-tested object also records a 5% completion-tokens-per-valid-
response tolerance and the observed relative spread across all valid tested
conditions before SLO filtering.
Exceeding it forces `state: inconclusive`; raw token totals are not compared
across duration-bounded conditions with different request counts.
Native multi-load execution is condition-major, so its best-tested object is
also forced inconclusive with `multi_condition_order_not_counterbalanced`.
This preserves a descriptive selected value without presenting an order-
confounded scan as a supported decision.

## Privacy contract

Persisted artifacts do not contain:

- endpoint URLs or hostnames;
- API keys, authorization headers, or inherited proxy values;
- prompts/messages or generated content;
- raw HTTP bodies, GuideLLM output, server exception strings, or temp paths; or
- raw accelerator fingerprints.

The manifest keeps canonical SHA-256 workload fingerprints, a hashed
accelerator fingerprint, validated non-secret runtime labels, engine-flag
names/values, and aggregate numeric samples. Native manifests also retain the
explicitly supplied non-secret request extension names and scalar values,
sealed by a canonical profile hash, so the effective request can be reproduced
and compared. CUDA decision-grade reports
require the existing immutable image, CUDA, and driver evidence. Metal, ROCm,
and CPU reports instead require a host OS version and immutable
software-environment digest; all platforms require an accelerator runtime
version. Workload hashes reveal equality and may confirm a guessed low-entropy
workload; they are not encryption. `throttle plan` is terminal-only and
intentionally displays the destination and the safe request profile before any
traffic.

Artifact references use a bounded non-secret label with an optional immutable
`@sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` suffix. Generated and loaded reports reject URLs,
credential-like labels, absolute/traversal paths, and control characters before
runtime evidence can be compared. Safe mutable labels and non-SHA-256 digest
references remain structurally readable for descriptive manifest 1.0
comparisons, but never satisfy the immutable decision-grade pin.

Saved and in-memory report boundaries are iterative and explicit: depth is
limited to 64 edges, total JSON nodes to 100,000, aggregate UTF-8 key/value text
to 20 MB, individual values to 16 KiB, and keys to 1 KiB. Duplicate keys,
non-finite or unsafe-magnitude numbers, cycles, custom containers, unsafe
Unicode categories, and NFKC-normalized credential/path lookalikes fail with
fixed non-reflective reason codes.

Schema 1.0 validation JSON under `validation/` is historical smoke evidence.
It is not auto-upgraded and `throttle compare` rejects it with
`legacy_schema_not_decision_grade`.
